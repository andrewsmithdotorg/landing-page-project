# landing-page-project
Repo for a [project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) from The Odin Project.  Objective: code a page that looks like supplied reference images ([one](landing-page-1.png), [two](landing-page-2.png)).

Note that since the reference image is 1440p and there's not a straightforward way to demonstrate what the page 'should' look like at different resolutions, this project is designed to be viewed from within a 1440p browser window.  When I start getting some responsive design practice in, I'd like to come back and see if I can preserve the styling when viewed in a bigger browser window.
